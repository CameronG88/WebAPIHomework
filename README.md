# Cam's WebAPIHomework

This project was to code out a timed quiz that kept track of the users score and took time away for wrong answers.

How it works

The page will open up with a welcome message and a button that will need to be pressed to start the quiz. Then the welcome elements clear and the first question is presented along with the corresponding answer choices and the timer begins to count down. If the user picks the correct answer 10 points is added to their score in the top of the screen and the next question is presented. If the wrong answer is picked 5 seconds is taken off of the timer and this will continue until the right answer is chosen.When either the timer runs out or all questions have been answered, the quiz will end.

Notes
I wanted to also add an end screen function that diplayed time left and the score however I ran out of time.
